**Who are we?**
Emergency Alert System Environment, EASE, is a revolutionary service that provides real-time data on the whereabouts of police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks through 3 distinct modes: 1) Driver 2) Pedestrian 3) Stationary. Users can select their desired notification method, whether it be via texts, emails, push notifications, or hands-free audio. 

**Why are we important?**
Local news like police chases, a burning fire, an ambulance rushing to get to the hospital, or sudden flash floods, are important news that will directly affect community residents. In times of chaotic traffic or a tiring drive home from work, we often panic and do not know how to respond to emergencies. Thus, EASE will alert you to pull over, stay still, or get help.

**Who are our partners?**
Our partners would consist of cities, both urban and rural, that are affected by the daily routines and routes of police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, and various natural disasters. Cities would vastly benefit from our services to further unite and further confirm and improve the safety of their citizens.
